Flatiron School is challenging and in no way is it something easy to do or something you can dedicate maybe a couple hours a day to and forget about. It requires dedication and a lot of hard work and of course, coding! Even something like a family reunion that lasts a few hours could interrupt and set you back some time in the course. The hardest part I have done was falling behind in Sinatra where I was fighting to catch up before my project review. Because of falling behind I had a hard time with the live lectures but I was able to make it in time for my project review! I'm glad to say I passed my project review and have now started Rails. 

Recently I saw a post in the Slack channel by a student who was wondering if they had the ability to complete this course because of the increasing difficulty of lessons and the fact that the lessons never seem to be enough to satisfy the knowledge requirement for the lab. This is sometimes true but in this case it doesn't mean that you are not able to finish the lab because the information isn't previously given to you in the course. There are many times that I have spent a few hours on Google to solve a lab because of information not given in the lab and this is beneficial to us as developers. As a professional developer, you will not be handed a lesson to complete your task and you must learn to effectively and efficiently use Google and StackOverflow to solve problems you come across or to imrpove your code after a code review. Flatiron School prepares you for this in advance by forcing you to have to come across some information on your own rather than give you everything and let you figure that out in your career. 

Sometimes the difficulty of the course can seem discouraging but it is to your benefit in the end and after 77 days in the course, I have already started to appreciate those nuances and started to become a more efficient researcher.

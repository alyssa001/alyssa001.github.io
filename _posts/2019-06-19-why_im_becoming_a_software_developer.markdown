```
My name is Alyssa Yesilyurt and two years ago I made the decision to become a software developer.I am currently enrolled in a Computer Engineering-B.S. degree at Florida International University but I wanted to find something that would get me work-ready in a shorter timeframe since I still have two years left for my degree. 
```

```
My family is Cuban and I am both first-generation born in the US and first-generation college student. I am the first person in my immediate family to graduate with a degree. Some background about me, I am very ambitious and when I put my mind to something I will achieve it. Seeing how my family came to this country with nothing and built their lives well-enough to give me the opportunity to study whatever I want makes me more motivated to succeed in my chosen field.

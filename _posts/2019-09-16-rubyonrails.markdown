Of all the projects we have done in our FlatIron curriculum, the most challenging by far has been Ruby on Rails, but it was also the most fun. I am guilty of having finished my project a bit later than I should have, but I am very glad to have taken the time for it. I created a trip management app that allows users to record trips they have taken and the destinations corresponding to them. Users can also create countries if they do not exist and they can log where they have traveled to. 

True to the project requirements I did not use scaffolding but I did use the resource generators as they saved a lot of time and prevented any errors due to spelling, etc. I chose to use a travel log theme because my first CLI project had the same theme and at this point I was honestly out of ideas. 

The omniauth feature with Facebook was a bit complicated to implement but I chose it over using the Google feature because I felt that it was simpler to implement and it was familiar to me, having used it in my previous labs.

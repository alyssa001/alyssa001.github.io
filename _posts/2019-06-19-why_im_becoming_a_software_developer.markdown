> My name is Alyssa Yesilyurt and two years ago I made the decision to become a software developer. I am currently enrolled in a Computer Engineering-B.S. degree at Florida International University but I wanted to find something that would get me work-ready in a shorter timeframe since I still have two years left for my degree. 

> My family is Cuban and I am both first-generation born in the US and first-generation college student. I am the first person in my immediate family to graduate with a degree. Some background about me, I am very ambitious and when I put my mind to something I will achieve it. Seeing how my family came to this country with nothing and built their lives well-enough to give me the opportunity to study whatever I want makes me more motivated to succeed in my chosen field. 

> Like most people, when I graduated high school I did consider an alternate career ~ a medical career ~ briefly and I also took some basic coding classes on the side since I was undecided if I wanted to go into the medical field or into engineering. Due to financial constraints I was unable to study for two years and my education was delayed, something that made me very frustrated and made me abandon the thought of studying engineering. 

> Once outside of the financial issue, I went to Istanbul, Turkey, for one year in order to learn the language and to give myself a break and a much-needed vacation. My major was English-Turkish Translation for the year since my focus was to learn the language. Since I knew that it was temporary, I spent a lot of time considering different career options and I once again came to an impasse about medicine or engineering. After returning to the US and being exposed to software engineering by friends and research, I decided to focus on software engineering.

> I spent maybe one year only focused on finishing Python books, doing React Tutorials, learning HTML & CSS, and JavaScript. I only decided to do FlatIron once I graduated with my AA in Computer Science and I saw how my skills were nowhere close to "job-ready". I am extremely happy I decided to do it as I have seen many success stories and I am excited to get through the course.

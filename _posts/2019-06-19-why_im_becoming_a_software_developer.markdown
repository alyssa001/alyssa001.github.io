> My name is Alyssa Yesilyurt and two years ago I made the decision to become a software developer. I am currently enrolled in a Computer Engineering-B.S. degree at Florida International University but I wanted to find something that would get me work-ready in a shorter timeframe since I still have two years left for my degree.

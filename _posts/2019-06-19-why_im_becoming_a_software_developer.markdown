     My name is Alyssa Yesilyurt and I decided to become a software developer about two years ago. At the moment I am enrolled in a Computer Engineering-B.S. degree at Florida International University but as far as software engineering goes, the program teaches very little as far as developer skills and only touches on the basics of Java and C++. I was interested to study software development when I started a basic Python book and I started searching for free online courses. I even completed most of the Python and JavaScript modules at Codecademy but it wasn't enough to get me job-ready or even to land a basic internship. My major had previously been Computer Science after graduating high school, but I had to put off my studies for awhile due to financial issues and that made me to lose focus of what I wanted. I always kept trying on my own to create something and finish tutorials but it was very basic compared to my idea for an app that I wanted to make. 
		 
		 Before starting FlatIron School I considered many career options but none of them called my attention. The majority of my work experience is in fields unrelated to my field of interest and after moving and starting a new job as a receptionist I met some locals who had gone through FlatIron and they recommended it to me. I am very optimistic about this course and I feel that this was the push I needed in the right direction to be able to work in my field and gain relevant experience.
